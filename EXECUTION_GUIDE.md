# Project Execution Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to execute the **Chat Based Sentiment Analysis** project.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**  
   Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
   You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Git**  
   Ensure Git is installed to clone the repository.  
   Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

3. **Required Libraries**  
   The project may depend on libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, and others.  
   Requirements are typically listed in a `requirements.txt` file.

## Steps to Execute

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ravuri-Jeetu/Chat_Based_Sentiment_Analysis.git
cd Chat_Based_Sentiment_Analysis
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate         # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate            # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not find a `requirements.txt`, you may manually install packages as needed:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

### 4. Prepare Data

- Place your chat data file (CSV, TXT, etc.) in the appropriate folder as specified by the project (e.g., `data/`).
- Ensure the data structure matches the expected format described in the project README or source code.

### 5. Run the Sentiment Analysis Script

- Identify the main execution file, usually named something like `main.py` or `sentiment_analysis.py`.
- Execute the script:

```sh
python main.py
```

Or, if the main file has a different name, replace `main.py` with the actual file name.

### 6. View Results

- Output will typically be printed to the console or saved to a file (e.g., results.csv).
- Check the documentation or script for details on how results are presented.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter missing package errors, install them using `pip install <package_name>`.
- For NLTK data, you may need to run:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('all')
```
in a Python shell.

## Additional Notes

- Refer to any additional documentation in the repository (e.g., README.md).
- For custom data or configuration, follow instructions provided in code comments or documentation.
